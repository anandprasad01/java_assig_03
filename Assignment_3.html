    Q1:- Write the Code for all Data types.
    Ans:- -> Number (let number=24;)
          -> String (let string="Hello world";)
          -> Boolean (let boolean= true;)
          -> Array (let array=[1,2,3,4])
          -> Undefined (let UndefinedValue;)
          -> Null (let nullvalue = null;)
          -> Symbol (let symbol = Symbol('unique');)
          -> Object (let student = { };)

    Q2:- What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
      Ans:- The uses of JavaScript Operators:-
            (a) Arithmetic Operators:- Used for basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding the remainder.
                Example = let result = 5 + 3; 
            
            (b) Assignment Operators:- Used to assign values to variables.
                Example = let x = 10;

            (c) Comparison Operators:- Used to compare values and make decisions.
                Example = let isEqual = (3 == "3");
                
            (d) Logical Operators:- Used for combining or negating conditions.
                Example = let andResult = (true && false);

            (e) Unary Operators:- Used for operations on a single operand.
                Example = let negativeNumber = -3;

            (f) String Concatenation Operator: Used to combine (concatenate) strings.
                Example = let fullName = "John" + " " + "Doe";

    Q3:-  Explain the Assignment Operator.
    Ans :-Assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. It initializes a variable with a specific value or updates its value based on an expression. 

    Q4:- Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
      Ans:- Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript are:-
      (a) Addition (+): Adds two values.
            Example = let sum = 5 + 3;
      
      (b) Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left.
            Example = let difference = 10 - 4;  
      
      (c) Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
            Example = let product = 2 * 6;  

      (d) Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right.
            Example = let quotient = 8 / 2;  
      
      (c) Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
            Example = let remainder = 10 % 3; 

    Q5:- What are the Binary Operators in js ?
        Ans:- A binary operator is an operator that takes two operands and returns a single operand. Binary operators are used in many programming languages, including JavaScript.

    Q6:- Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
        Ans:- In pre-increment, the value of the variable is increased before the value is used in the expression.
                let x = 5;
                let y = ++x; 
                console.log(x); 
                console.log(y); 

                In post-increment, the current value of the variable is used in the expression before it is incremented.
                let x = 5;
                let y = ++x; 
                console.log(x); 
                console.log(y);
